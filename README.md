# hotel-stats-dashboard
### Practice for dash & plotly
This dashboard was built to gain experience with Dash & Plotly during a training course assignment. I also made use of the Rakuten API to gather hotel data, aiming to deepen my understanding of how to use APIs effectively.

In order to explore various layouts and styles, each component was designed with a different layout.

As a potential enhancement for future development, it may be beneficial to include components based on time-series data.
